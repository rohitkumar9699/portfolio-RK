Running Your Portfolio Website Locally
Here's a step-by-step guide to set up and run your portfolio website on your local machine:

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 18 or newer)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [repository-folder-name]
Step 2: Install Dependencies
All the required libraries are defined in the package.json file. Install them using:

npm install
This will install all the necessary packages including:

React and React DOM
Express (for the server)
Tailwind CSS
Framer Motion (for animations)
Lucide React (for icons)
React Icons
Shadcn UI components
TypeScript
Vite
Drizzle ORM
Zod (for validation)
React Hook Form
TanStack Query (for data fetching)
Wouter (for routing)
Step 3: Start the Development Server
Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the application:

npm run dev
This command will:

Start the Express server for the backend
Start the Vite development server for the frontend
Combine them so they run on the same port
Step 4: Access the Website
Open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:5000
Project Structure Overview
/client - Frontend React application
/server - Backend Express server
/shared - Shared types and schemas between frontend and backend
Making Changes
Frontend changes: Edit files in the /client/src directory
Backend changes: Edit files in the /server directory
Shared schemas: Edit files in the /shared directory
Building for Production
When you're ready to deploy:

npm run build
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors during installation, make sure you're using a compatible Node.js version
If the server fails to start, check that port 5000 is not already in use
For TypeScript errors, check that your types are properly defined
The project is set up to hot-reload when you make changes, so you can edit the files and see the changes immediately in your browser.
